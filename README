PeekPop bug:
==============
Make sure you have an iPhone 6S/6S+.

1. Set the force touch sensitivity to the most sensitive setting.
2. Invoke force touch action by gently pressing into the screen. You might have to do this several times before the issue occurs.
3. The screen should freeze, but the app should still be running. Debug the app using View Hierarchy debugger.
